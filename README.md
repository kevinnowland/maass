# Effective computation of Maass cusp forms

The goal of this package is to implement the algorithm for
effective computation of Maass cusp forms to some precision as
presented in [Booker, Strombergsson, and Venkatesh](https://www.math.ias.edu/~akshay/research/bsv.pdf).

The actual goal of this package is to get me familiar with golang.

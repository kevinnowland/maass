# Effective computation of Maass cusp forms

The goal of this module is to implement the algorithm for
effective computation of Maass cusp forms to some precision as
presented in [Booker, Strombergsson, and Venkatesh](https://www.math.ias.edu/~akshay/research/bsv.pdf).

The actual goal of this module is to get me familiar with golang.

## Module layout

It seems that in the [list of awesome go packages](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go)
many of the modules are basically flat, so that's what I'm going with instead of
the more structured [golang standard project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout),
most of which I would ignore anyway.
